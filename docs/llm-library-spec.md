# Moog MUSE Library Specification

This specification defines the directory and database structure used by the Moog MUSE Manager application for managing synthesizer libraries. It ensures consistent import/export between a filesystem layout and a normalized database model.

| library/sequences/bank03/seq05/new sequence.mmseq | patch\_sequences | `sequence_number = 5`, `name = 'new sequence'` |

---

## ‚úÖ Import Processing Rules

* `library.name` = directory name selected by user
* `library.fingerprint` = SHA-256 hash of all file contents recursively

### Banks

* 16 required `bankXX` directories
* `.bank` file required in each, named from `banks.name`
* Folder name becomes `banks.system_name`
* Content of `.bank` file is stored as binary in `banks.content`

### Patches

* Up to 16 `patchYY` directories per bank
* Each may contain 1 `.mmp` file ‚Üí `patches.name`
* If no `.mmp` file: mark `default_patch = TRUE`, `content = NULL`
* `favorited = FALSE`, `tags = []` (default)

### Sequences

* Stored under `library/sequences/bankXX/seqYY/`
* Each must contain 1 `.mmseq` file ‚Üí `patch_sequences.name`
* If missing, use default: `new sequence.mmseq`

### Validation

* Import fails with descriptive error if directory does not strictly conform

---

## üì§ Export Processing Rules

* Target export directory is selected by the user
* Application creates a folder with the name of the selected library

### Banks and Patches

* Exactly 16 `bankYY` folders exported, sorted by `bank_number`
* Each bank contains:

  * One `.bank` file: name = `banks.name`
  * 16 `patchYY/` subfolders from `patch_number`
  * `.mmp` file written only if `default_patch = FALSE` and `content IS NOT NULL`

### Sequences

* Structure: `library/sequences/bankYY/seqYY/`
* All 16 `bankYY` and 16 `seqYY` subfolders exported
* Each `seqYY/` must contain one `.mmseq` file from `patch_sequences.name`

### Naming

* Folder names follow `bankYY`, `patchYY`, `seqYY` where `YY = zero-padded number`
* File names are derived from the `name` field in the database

### Validation

* Export fails if required data (bank, patch, sequence) is missing

## üß© Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE libraries (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT UNIQUE,
  fingerprint TEXT UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE banks (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  bank_number INTEGER,
  library_id INTEGER,
  name TEXT,
  system_name TEXT,
  type TEXT CHECK(type IN ('patch', 'sequence')),
  content BLOB,
  fingerprint TEXT UNIQUE,
  FOREIGN KEY(library_id) REFERENCES libraries(id)
);

CREATE TABLE patches (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  patch_number INTEGER,
  bank_id INTEGER,
  fingerprint TEXT UNIQUE,
  content TEXT,
  name TEXT,
  default_patch BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  favorited BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  tags TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY(bank_id) REFERENCES banks(id)
);

CREATE TABLE patch_sequences (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  sequence_number INTEGER,
  bank_id INTEGER,
  name TEXT,
  fingerprint TEXT UNIQUE,
  content TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY(bank_id) REFERENCES banks(id)
);
```

## üìù File Format: .mmseq

Each `.mmseq` file defines a musical step sequence. The file is a plain-text format consisting of two main blocks: `Settings` and `Steps`, enclosed in braces and terminated with semicolons.

### Top-Level Structure

```
Version = 2;
Settings : { ... };
Steps : { ... };
```

---

### üîß Settings Block

Defines global sequence parameters.

### üéº Steps Block

Contains 64 steps, each defining up to 8 notes and variations.

```
Steps : {
  Step1 : {
    <step-fields>
    Note1 : { <note-fields> };
    CoinToss1 : { <note-fields> };
    ...
    Note8 : { ... }
    CoinToss8 : { ... }
  }
  ...
  Step64 : { ... }
}
```

#### Step-Level Fields

| Field                 | Type    | Description                       |

#### Note/CoinToss Fields

Each `NoteX` and `CoinTossX` object includes:

| Field      | Type    | Description                           |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Timbre     | Integer | Timbre index (0 = default)            |
| Pitch      | Integer | MIDI pitch value                      |

| TimeOffset | Integer | Timing offset in ticks                |
| IsTie      | Boolean | Note continues from previous step     |

---

### üîç Notes

* All values are semicolon-terminated
* File is plain-text and ASCII-encoded
* Steps without active notes may still include CoinToss or probability logic
* Only `Length` number of steps (1‚Äì64) are considered active during playback
* Note/CoinToss pairs allow for expressive probabilistic alternation

This specification enables deterministic and probabilistic playback modeling for hardware or software sequencers.

This format is optimized for ingestion by tooling, LLMs, and validation engines.
